# Wallpaper from Url (for ChromeOS)  <img align="right" src="https://raw.github.com/rpbritton/wallpaper-from-url-for-chromeos/master/src/img/icon128.png">
This chrome extension sets your wallpaper in ChromeOS to a image url. It works great with random wallpaper urls like Unsplash Source, which can be scheduled to update at certain times. The default url is [https://source.unsplash.com/random/1920x1080/](https://source.unsplash.com/random/1920x1080/).
## Installation
1. Download the extension [here](https://raw.github.com/rpbritton/wallpaper-from-url-for-chromeos/master/wallpaper-from-url-for-chromeos.crx).
2. Or load the `src` directory of this repository as an unpacked extension in `chrome://extensions`.
3. You may need to install the [Chrome Apps & Extensions Developer Tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-apps-extensions-de/ohmmkhmmmpcnpikjeljgnaoabkaalbgc) if chrome blocks it.
